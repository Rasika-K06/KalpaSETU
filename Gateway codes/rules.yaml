# rules.yaml
# Configuration file for the SETU Gateway Node's autonomous alerting engine.
#
# Each item in the 'rules' list defines a condition that will trigger an alert.
# The DataProcessingThread loads this file at startup.

# Placeholders in 'alert_message':
#   {node}: Will be replaced with the node_id.
#   {value}: Will be replaced with the actual value that triggered the alert.
#   {threshold}: Will be replaced with the threshold value from this file.
